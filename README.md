# Public Key and Signature Verification Tool

## Overview
This tool allows users to:
1. Extract a **public key** from a `README.md` file or another specified file.
2. Verify that a **public key** uploaded to a repository matches the owner's public key listed in the `README.md`.
3. Validate a **cryptographic signature** for a given message to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Key Features
- Extracts public keys from files in PEM format.
- Compares uploaded public keys with the official public key listed in the `README.md`.
- Verifies cryptographic signatures for secure validation of ownership or authenticity.
- Provides clear and user-friendly feedback with visual indicators.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Input Files
Make sure the following files are available in the project directory:
- **`README.md` or another file with the public key**:
  - Contains the owner's public key in PEM format.
- **`public_key.pem`**:
  - The uploaded public key to compare.
- **`signature.bin`**:
  - The cryptographic signature to validate.
- **`message.txt`**:
  - The original message that was signed.

### 2. Execution
Run the Python script to verify the public key and signature:

```bash
python run.py
```

## File Formats
### 1.Public Key (`public_key.pem` or in `README.md`)
The public key must be in PEM format, as shown below:


```vbnet
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
<base64-encoded key content>
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```
### 2. Signature (`signature.bin`)
The signature is a binary file generated by signing the message using the private key.

### 3. Original Message (`message.txt`)
A plain-text file containing the original message that was signed.

## Verification Process
1. **Extract Public Keys:**

- Extract the owner's public key from `README.md`.
- Extract the uploaded public key from `public_key.pem`.
2. **Compare Public Keys:**

- Ensure that the uploaded public key matches the one in `README.md`.
3. **Verify Signature:**

- Use the public key from README.md to validate the signature for the message in `message.txt`.
4. **Output:**

- The script provides clear feedback:
- - ✅ Success: Public keys match, and the signature is valid.
- - ❌ Error: Public key mismatch or invalid signature.

## Sample Output
### Successful Verification

```vbnet
🚀 Starting verification process...
📜 Public key extracted successfully from README.md!
📜 Public key extracted successfully from the file!
🔍 Comparing public keys...
✅ Public keys match! 🎉
📑 Signature file loaded successfully!
📝 Original message file loaded successfully!
🔑 Verifying the signature...
🎉 Signature is valid! 🟢
✅ Verification process completed successfully! 🎊
```
### Failure Case (Invalid Signature)
```vbnet
🚀 Starting verification process...
📜 Public key extracted successfully from README.md!
📜 Public key extracted successfully from the file!
🔍 Comparing public keys...
✅ Public keys match! 🎉
📑 Signature file loaded successfully!
📝 Original message file loaded successfully!
🔑 Verifying the signature...
❌ Signature verification failed: Invalid signature detected!
```

## How to Generate Files
### Generate Keys
You can generate the public-private key pair using the following script:
```bash
python generator.py
```
- **Output**
  - `private_key.pem:` Private key (keep this secure).
  - `public_key.pem:` Public key for sharing.
  - `signature.bin:` (the cryptographic signature).

#### Verify a Signature
Run the verification script:
```bash
python run.py
```
### Public Key Example in `README.md`
The following is an example of how the public key should be included in the `README.md:`

#### Repository Owner's Public Key

This is the official public key for verifying cryptographic signatures for this repository:

```plaintext
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```
